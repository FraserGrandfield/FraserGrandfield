I am a developer with a BSc in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a MSc in Cyber Security. I specifically enjoy developing back-ends of applications and the security which needs to be implimented into them. A hobby of mine is learning about cosmology and quantum physics which also has led into my interest in quantum computers and quantum cryptography.
