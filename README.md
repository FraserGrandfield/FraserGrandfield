I am a developer with a BSc in Computer Science and am currently pursuing an MSc in Cyber Security. I specifically enjoy developing the back-end of applications and the security thats implemented in them. A hobby of mine is learning cosmology and quantum physics, this led me into my interest in quantum computers and quantum cryptography.
